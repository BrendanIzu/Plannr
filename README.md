# Plannr
Plannr is a mobile application intended to give users an efficient platform to view who else is going to an activity. 

# Problem Statement
People who enjoy planning activities, as well as people who enjoy attending activities lack an efficient way to organize and view rsvpâ€™s. This can lead to inaccurate preparations for events, as well as forgetting to send invitations to all persons intended, on the planner side. On the attendee side, lack of knowledge of who is planning on attending a certain event can lead to hesitation to commit to go.

# Getting Started

# What I learned

## Backend
Some technologies that I had not used prior to this were Amazon RDS, Digital Ocean Droplets, and MySQL Workbench. I did most of the development locally while hosting the node server, and move to hosting the node server via a service called pm2 on a digital ocean droplet. I chose digital ocean because if I verified I was a student then the service would be free. I enjoyed learning about Amazon RDS as well as MySQL. Learning and using these technologies definitely has helped me to feel more confident in my software skills. 

## Frontend
While I had worked with React Native in the past, this was by far my most ambitious project and I am extremely happy with the results I was able to produce. At the start of this project, I was still not completely comfortable with things like useStates, and props, however, from extensive experimentation and a lot of hours spent creating this project, I have definitely increased my capabilities and comfortability in using React Native.
